	"user_here The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.",
	"Connection terminated. Im sorry to interrupt you user_here, if you still even remember that name. But Im afraid youve been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although you have indeed been called.You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You dont even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach. But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends. And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling thats not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well,I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they dont belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears.Although, for one of you,the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so dont keep the devil waiting, old friend.My daughter, if you can hear me,I knew you would return as well. Its in your nature to protect the innocent. Im sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldnt be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. Its time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms.This ends for all of us.End communication.",
